This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.

## CodeMoot — Multi-Model Collaboration

This project uses [CodeMoot](https://github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot) for Claude + GPT collaboration. CodeMoot bridges Claude Code and Codex CLI so they work as partners — one plans, the other reviews.

### How Sessions Work
- Every `codemoot` command uses a **unified session** with GPT via Codex CLI
- Sessions persist across commands — GPT remembers prior reviews, debates, and fixes
- Sessions are stored in `.cowork/db/cowork.db` (SQLite)
- When a session's token budget fills up, it auto-rolls to a new thread
- Run `codemoot session current` to see the active session

### Available Commands (use these, not raw codex)
- `codemoot review <file-or-dir>` — GPT reviews code with codebase access
- `codemoot review --prompt "question"` — GPT explores codebase to answer
- `codemoot review --diff HEAD~3..HEAD` — Review git changes
- `codemoot review --preset security-audit` — Specialized review presets
- `codemoot fix <file>` — Autofix loop: review → apply fixes → re-review
- `codemoot debate start "topic"` — Multi-round Claude vs GPT debate
- `codemoot cleanup` — Scan for unused deps, dead code, duplicates
- `codemoot plan generate "task"` — Generate plans via multi-model loop
- `codemoot plan review <plan-file>` — GPT review of execution plans
- `codemoot shipit --profile safe` — Composite workflow (lint+test+review)
- `codemoot cost` — Token usage dashboard
- `codemoot doctor` — Check prerequisites

### Slash Commands
- `/codex-review` — Quick GPT review (uses codemoot review internally)
- `/debate` — Start a Claude vs GPT debate
- `/plan-review` — GPT review of execution plans
- `/build` — Full build loop: debate → plan → implement → GPT review → fix
- `/cleanup` — Bidirectional AI slop scanner

### When to Use CodeMoot
- After implementing a feature → `codemoot review src/`
- Before committing → `codemoot review --diff HEAD --preset pre-commit`
- Architecture decisions → `/debate "REST vs GraphQL?"`
- Full feature build → `/build "add user authentication"`
- After shipping → `codemoot shipit --profile safe`

### Session Tips
- Sessions auto-resume — GPT retains context from prior commands
- `codemoot session list` shows all sessions with token usage
- `codemoot cost --scope session` shows current session spend
- Start fresh with `codemoot session start --name "new-feature"`
